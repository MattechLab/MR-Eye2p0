# 2.0 MR-Eye

A repository for all acquisition, reconstruction, and analysis code associated with the registered report submission.

The standard operation procedure is available [here](https://mattechlab.github.io/sops/debi/data-collection/data-collection_DEBI_protocol/).


## ðŸš€ **Overview**

This repository provides full transparency into every step of the experimental pipeline, as follows:
1.	MR Data Acquisition
    - Sequence implementations using Pulseq for control of MR pulse sequences. 
    - Codes for generating eyeâ€‘tracking visual stimuli implemented using PsychoPy.
2. MRI Image Reconstruction
    - Reconstruction scripts leveraging the Monalisa Reconstruction Toolbox to convert raw k-space data into images.
3.	Data Analysis & Conversion
      - Alignment, preprocessing, statistical analysis, and format conversion (e.g. DICOM to NIfTI/ MAT to BIDs).
