# 2.0 MR-Eye

A repository for all acquisition, reconstruction, and analysis code associated with the registered report submission.

The standard operation procedure is available [here](https://mattechlab.github.io/sops/debi/data-collection/data-collection_DEBI_protocol/).


## ðŸš€ **Overview**

This repository provides full transparency into every step of the experimental pipeline, as follows:
1.	MR Data Acquisition
    - [Sequence implementations](https://github.com/MattechLab/pulseq4mreye) using Pulseq (V1.5) for control of MR pulse sequences. 
    - [Codes](https://github.com/Evelyn92/MREye_psychopy) for generating eyeâ€‘tracking visual stimuli implemented using PsychoPy (V24.2).
2. MRI Image Reconstruction
    - [ET data processing](https://github.com/Evelyn92/hcph-sops-fork) for ET mask generation is implemented with Python 3.8.
    - [Reconstruction scripts](https://github.com/Evelyn92/Recon_scripts) leveraging MATLAB R2024a and the [Monalisa Reconstruction Toolbox](https://mattechlab.github.io/monalisa/) to convert raw k-space data into images.
3.	Data Analysis & Conversion
    - [Alignment, preprocessing](https://github.com/Evelyn92/Recon_scripts/tree/master/func/spm_related) with MATLAB R2024a and SPM 12, [image quality assessment with statistical analysis](https://github.com/Evelyn92/Quant) with Jupyter Notebook, and format conversion (e.g. DICOM to NIfTI/ MAT to BIDs).
